[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1056263/dmytro-danylyk) is my favorite site for self-development. Answers to questions improve both - technical and communication skills at the same time. When I read other excellent answers I gain knowledge and inspiration to reach that level.

and questions where I wrote highly-ranked answers) is **1.4 million**.
